Inhibition of expression of BmNPV cg30 by bmo-miRNA-390 is a host response to baculovirus invasion.

[Astract]
Bombyx mori larvae exhibit in vivo defensive reactions immediately after invasion by a virus. One of these defense systems is to express appropriate microRNAs (miRNAs) to respond to the infection. A novel Bombyx mori-encoded miRNA, bmo-miR-390, was identified previously by high-throughput sequencing. Based on bioinformatic predictions, the Bombyx mori nuclear polyhedrosis virus cg30 gene (BmNPV-cg30) is one of the target genes of bmo-miR-390. In this study, expression vectors with an enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) or a luciferase (luc) reporter gene together with bm-miR-390 or the cg30 3' UTR were constructed and used to co-transfect BmN cells. Using a dual luciferase reporter (DLR) assay, we found that bmo-miR-390 significantly downregulates the expression of BmNPV-cg30 (P < 0.05) in vitro. Moreover, artificially synthesized bmo-miR-390 mimics enhanced the regulatory effect of bmo-miR-390, while an inhibitor eliminated the inhibitory effect. These results show for the first time that bmo-miR-390 can effectively downregulate the expression of BmNPV-cg30 in BmNPV-infected BmN cells.
