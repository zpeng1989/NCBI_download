Oleoylethanolamide modulates glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist signaling and enhances Exendin-4-mediated weight loss in obese mice.

[Astract]
Long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP1) receptor (GLP1R) agonists (GLP1RA), like Exendin-4 (Ex4), promote weight loss. Based on a newly-discovered interaction between GLP1 and oleoylethanolamide (OEA), we tested whether OEA enhances GLP1RA-mediated anorectic signaling and weight loss. We analyzed the effect of GLP1+OEA and Ex4+OEA on canonical GLP1R signaling and other proteins/pathways that contribute to the hypophagic action of GLP1RA (AMPK, Akt, mTOR and glycolysis). We demonstrate that OEA enhances canonical GLP1R signaling when combined with GLP1 but not with Ex4. GLP1 and Ex4 promote phosphorylation of mTOR pathway components, but OEA does not enhance this effect. OEA synergistically enhanced GLP1- and Ex4-stimulated glycolysis but did not augment the hypophagic action of GLP1 or Ex4 in lean or diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. However, the combination of Ex4+OEA promoted greater weight loss in DIO mice than Ex4 or OEA alone during a 7-day treatment. This was due in part to transient hypophagia and increased energy expenditure, phenotypes also observed in Ex4-treated DIO mice. Thus, OEA augments specific GLP1RA-stimulated signaling but appears to work in parallel with Ex4 to promote weight loss in DIO mice. Elucidating cooperative mechanisms underlying Ex4+OEA-mediated weight loss could, therefore, be leveraged towards more effective obesity therapies.
