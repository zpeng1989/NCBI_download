Pathway Analysis Hints Towards Beneficial Effects of Long-Term Vibration on Human Chondrocytes.

[Astract]
BACKGROUND/AIMS:Spaceflight negatively influences the function of cartilage tissue in vivo. In vitro human chondrocytes exhibit an altered gene expression of inflammation markers after a two-hour exposure to vibration. Little is known about the impact of long-term vibration on chondrocytes.
