Effect of essential amino acid кetoanalogues and protein restriction diet on morphogenetic proteins (FGF-23 and Кlotho) in 3b-4 stages chronic кidney disease patients: a randomized pilot study.

[Astract]
BACKGROUND:A low protein diet (LPD) with essential amino acid ketoanalogue supplementation (KA) may contribute in improving of chronic kidney disease (CKD), while the exact mechanisms of KA's effect are not established yet. We have conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled comparative study of LPD + KA and LPD alone in relation to serum Klotho, FGF-23 levels in CKD patients.
