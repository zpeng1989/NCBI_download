Effect of fibrillation conditions on the anti-amyloidogenic properties of polyphenols and their involved mechanisms.

[Astract]
In the present study, we have investigated the effects of protein concentration and stirring on the in vitro assembly of Hen Egg White Lysozyme (HEWL), particularly with regard to the aggregate morphology and anti-amyloidogenic properties of two naturally occurring polyphenols, taxifolin and silibinin. The results obtained clearly demonstrated that applying stirring and concentration enhancement alter the amount as well as morphology of amyloid fibrils formed. Additionally, latter aggregates exhibited higher affinity for amyloid-specific dyes. The second part of the present investigation was devoted to studies involving anti-amyloidogenic properties of selected polyphenols. Importantly, we found that the potency of polyphenols to inhibit HEWL amyloid fibrillation and related toxicity is strongly dependent on the amyloidogenic conditions in which amyloid fibrils are produced. Based on obtained data, under condition where the rate of protein assembly is high (higher protein concentration and stirring), the capacity of polyphenols to inhibit HEWL fibrillogenesis and related cytotoxicity may dramatically decrease. Similar results were obtained when we used taxifolin to inhibit bovine insulin amyloid fibrillation. Additionally, amyloidogenic conditions may also affect the mechanism by which these molecules inhibit HEWL fibrillation. The possible mechanism by which selected polyphenols exert their inhibitory effects, under various experimental conditions, is also discussed.
