Is There Any Necessity to Prescribe Consumption of Walnuts Cooked by Different Processing Techniques to Patients With Walnut Allergy?

[Astract]
The present study focused on identifying the usual methods of cooking walnuts in order to investigate changes in walnut allergen activity caused by cooking and evaluated the allergenic changes in walnut proteins within raw, dry-fried and boiled walnuts. Previous studies have reported a decrease in the allergen activity of walnut by thermal processing methods, which are not used in Korean kitchens, such as dry-frying and boiling. In Korea, Walnuts are consumed with rice and usually boiled and stir-fried with seasoning. Thus, the present study clarified the protein bands corresponding to raw walnuts and confirmed that the patterns of each walnut protein differ depending on cooking methods. This concern may be a very crucial point to understand the other tree nuts allergy as well as walnut allergy. The results of the present study differ from those of previous studies performed in Europe, although further studies with older participants are needed in order to draw more definite conclusions on lipid transfer protein (LTP). The other crucial point is that the findings of the present study support existing findings that the allergenic components of walnut have varying antigenicity depending on cooking methods. The allergenic components of walnut identified using diagnostic tests for walnut allergic patients could be reduced in walnuts cooked by different processing techniques. The allergenic components of walnut have varying allergen activity depending on cooking methods. Therefore, the allergenic components of walnuts identified using diagnostic tests for walnut allergic patients could allow physicians to prescribe consumption of walnuts cooked by different processing techniques to patients with walnut allergy.
