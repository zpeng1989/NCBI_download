Diagnosis of bovine mastitis: from laboratory to farm.

[Astract]
Accurate diagnosis of disease is the major step between the cause and cure of disease. An economical, reliable, and rapid diagnostic tool is fundamental for the management of udder health. The earlier the disease is identified, the less will be the damage; keeping this in mind, many efforts are being made to develop reliable diagnostic tools for use on farm. However, traditional gold standard methods including somatic cell count and microbial culturing are still in use. They are partially being replaced with polymerase chain reaction and sequencing-based tests. Nanotechnology and protein-based tests have also gained lot of attention and some of them are potential candidate of future diagnostic tests for bovine mastitis. Research laboratories are struggling to develop simple, economical, and user-friendly biosensor-based methods that can be performed on farm for rapid diagnosis. The combination of both genomic and proteomic approaches, together with further involvement of nanotheranostic technologies and other sensors, will assist in the quest of better mastitis diagnostic tools.
