The Importance of Se-Related Genes in the Chondrocyte of Kashin-Beck Disease Revealed by Whole Genomic Microarray and Network Analysis.

[Astract]
Kashin-Beck disease (KBD) is an endemic, chronic, and degenerative osteoarthropathy. Selenium (Se) deficiency plays important role in the pathogenesis of KBD. We aimed to screen Se-related gene from chondrocytes of patients with KBD. Whole-genome oligonucleotide microarrays were used to detect differentially expressed genes. qRT-PCR was used to confirm the microarray results. Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) was used to screen Se-related genes from differentially expressed genes. Gene Ontology (GO) classifications and network analysis of Se-related genes were constituted by STRING online system. Three hundred ninety-nine differentially expressed genes were obtained from microarray. Among them, 54 Se-related genes were identified by CTD. The qRT-PCR validation showed that four genes expressed similarly with the ones in the microarray transcriptional profiles. The Se-related genes were categorized into 6 cellular components, 8 molecular functions, 44 biological processes, 10 pathways, and 1 network by STRING. The Se-related gene insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 (IGFBP2), insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP3), interleukin 6 (IL6), BCL2, apoptosis regulator (BCL2), and BCL2-associated X, apoptosis regulator (BAX), which involved in many molecular functions, biological processes, and apoptosis pathway may play important roles in the pathogenesis of KBD.
