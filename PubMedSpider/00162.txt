BGP-15 improves contractile function of regenerating soleus muscle.

[Astract]
This study investigated the effect of the heat shock protein inducer O-[3-piperidino-2-hydroxy-1-propyl]-nicotinic amidoxime (BGP-15) on the morphology and contractile function of regenerating soleus muscles from mice. Cryolesioned soleus muscles from young mice treated daily with BGP-15 (15 mg/Kg) were evaluated on post-cryolesion day 10. At this time point, there was a significant decrease in the cross-sectional area of regenerating myofibers, maximal force, specific tetanic force, and fatigue resistance of regenerating soleus muscles. BGP-15 did not reverse the decrease in myofiber cross-sectional area but effectively prevented the reduction in tetanic force and fatigue resistance of regenerating muscles. In addition, BGP-15 treatment increased the expression of embryonic myosin heavy chain (e-MyHC), MyHC-II and MyHC-I in regenerating muscles. Although BGP-15 did not alter voltage dependent anion-selective channel 2 (VDAC2) expression in cryolesioned muscles, it was able to increase inducible 70-kDa heat shock protein (HSP70) expression. Our results suggest that BGP-15 improves strength recovery in regenerating soleus muscles by accelerating the re-expression of adult MyHC-II and MyHC-I isoforms and HSP70 induction. The beneficial effects of BGP-15 on the contractile function of regenerating muscles reinforce the potential of this molecule to be used as a therapeutic agent.
