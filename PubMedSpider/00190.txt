Promotion of wound healing through low-fluence ablative fractional laser treatment in diabetic mice.

[Astract]
Chronic ulcers are a significant cause of morbidity in diabetic patients, which can greatly affect a patient's quality of life. While numerous methods have been developed to promote and enhance wound healing in diabetic patients, a convenient, effective treatment for diabetic ulcers has yet to be established. Here, we demonstrate the promotion of wound healing using a low-fluence (2 mJ/spot) ablative fractional laser (AFL) treatment in diabetic mice. Treatment was shown to confer increases in mRNA expression and in protein abundance of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), along with decreases in mRNA expression and protein abundance of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-Î²). Taken together, these results suggest that low-fluence AFL treatment can be used to promote healing in chronic diabetic wounds.
