Andrographolide Ameliorates Atherosclerosis by Suppressing Pro-Inflammation and ROS Generation-Mediated Foam Cell Formation.

[Astract]
Inflammation, oxidative stress, and dyslipidemia are major factors in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Andrographolide, a bioactive component of Andrographis paniculata, has several biological activities, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticancer effects. This study shows that andrographolide downregulates the oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL)-induced expression of the pro-inflammatory molecules monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 and interleukin (IL)-6 and blocks the nuclear factor-ÎºB signaling pathway in macrophages. Additionally, andrographolide treatment decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in oxLDL-induced macrophages, indicating that the compound can decrease oxidative stress. The results also suggest that andrographolide suppresses oxLDL-induced foam cell formation and inhibits oxLDL-induced CD36 expression in vitro. Furthermore, in vivo studies have indicated that andrographolide treatment ameliorates atherosclerosis pathogenesis in apolipoprotein E knockout mice. Therefore, by suppressing inflammation, ROS generation, and foam cell formation, andrographolide may ameliorate the progression of atherosclerosis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic drug for the prevention and/or treatment of this disease.
