Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of mankind's greatest afflictions. It is the most common degenerative illness of the human nervous system and the leading form of dementia worldwide. Almost unknown to the community 40 years ago, AD affects approximately 1-2% of the world's population, with ageing the highest risk factor. The neuropathological features of AD are mainly intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) consisting of hyperphosphorylated tau protein and extracellular amyloid beta (AÎ²) plaques (Mandelkow & Mandelkow, 1998; Serrano-Pozo et al., 2011). However, the best correlate with clinical dementia is the characteristic neuronal and synaptic loss. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
