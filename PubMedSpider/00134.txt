Individually coated microneedles for co-delivery of multiple compounds with different properties.

[Astract]
Microneedle (MN) patches provide a simple method for delivery of drugs that might otherwise require hypodermic injection. Conventional MN patch fabrication methods typically can load only one or possibly multiple miscible agents with the same formulation on all MNs, which limits the combination and spatial distribution of drugs and formulations having different properties (such as solubility) in a single patch. In this study, we coated MNs individually instead of coating all MNs from the same formulation, making possible a patch where each individual MN is coated with different formulations and drugs. In this way, individually coated MN patches co-delivered multiple agents with different physicochemical characteristics (immiscible molecules, proteins, and nanoparticles) and in different spatial patterns in the skin. MN loading was adjusted by modifying the number of coating layers, and co-delivery of multiple agents was demonstrated in the porcine skin. We conclude that individually coating MNs enables co-delivery of multiple different compounds and formulations with needle-by-needle spatial control in the skin.
