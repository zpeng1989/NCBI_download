Differential Regulation of Cell Proliferation and Apoptosis by Melatonin Receptor Subtype-Signaling in the Adult Murine Brain.

[Astract]
<br>Background/Aims: Zeitgeber time (ZT)-dependent changes in cell proliferation and apoptosis are regulated by melatonin receptor (MT)-mediated signaling in the adult hippocampus and hypothalamic-hypophyseal system. There are two G-protein-coupled MT-subtypes, MT1 and MT2. Therefore, the present study examined which MT-subtype is required for regulation of ZT-dependent changes in cell proliferation and/or apoptosis in the adult murine brain and pituitary.
