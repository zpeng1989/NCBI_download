Transport of late endosomes and lysosome-related organelles (LE/LROs) in axons is essential for supplying synaptic cargos and for removing damaged macromolecules. Defects in this system are implicated in a range of human neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders. The findings reported here identify a novel mechanism regulating LE/LRO transport based on the coordinated coupling of microtubule motors and vesicle coat proteins to the neuron-enriched, transmembrane protein Calcyon (Caly). We found that the cytoplasmic C-terminus of Caly pulled down proteins involved in microtubule dependent transport (DIC, KIF5A, p150Glued, Lis1) and organelle biogenesis (AP-1 and AP-3) from brain. In addition, RNAi mediated knockdown of Caly increased the percent of static LE/LROs labeled by LysoTracker in cultured dorsal root ganglion axons. In contrast, over-expression of Caly stimulated movement of organelles positive for LysoTracker or the AP-3 cargo GFP-PI4KIIÎ±. However, a Caly mutant (ATEA) that does not bind AP-3 was unable to pull down motor proteins from brain, and expression of the ATEA mutant failed to increase either LE/LRO flux or levels of associated dynein. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that Caly is a multifunctional scaffolding protein that regulates axonal transport of LE/LROs by coordinately interacting with motor and vesicle coat proteins.
