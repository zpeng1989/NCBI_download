Protein phosphatase 2A is crucial for sarcomere organization in C. elegans striated muscle.

Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a heterotrimer composed of single catalytic and scaffolding subunits, and one of several possible regulatory subunits. We identified PPTR-2, a regulatory subunit of PP2A, as a binding partner for the giant muscle protein UNC-89 (obscurin) in C. elegans. PPTR-2 is required for sarcomere organization when its paralog, PPTR-1, is deficient. PPTR-2 localizes to the sarcomere at dense bodies and M-lines, co-localizing with UNC-89 at M-lines. PP2A components in C. elegans include one catalytic subunit, LET-92, one scaffolding subunit, PAA-1, and 5 regulatory subunits (SUR-6, PPTR-1, PPTR-2, RSA-1, and CASH-1). In adult muscle, loss of function in any of these subunits results in sarcomere disorganization. rsa-1 mutants show an interesting phenotype: one of the two myosin heavy chains, MHC A, localizes as closely-spaced double lines rather than single lines. This "double line" phenotype is found in rare missense mutants of the head domain of MHC B myosin, such as unc-54(s74). Analysis of phosphoproteins in the unc-54(s74) mutant revealed two additional phosphoserines in the non-helical tailpiece of MHC A. Antibodies localize PPTR-1, PAA-1, and SUR-6 to I-bands, and RSA-1 to M-lines and I-bands. Therefore, PP2A localizes to sarcomeres and functions in the assembly or maintenance of sarcomeres.
