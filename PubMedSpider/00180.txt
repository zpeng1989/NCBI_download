Dendritic Cells as an Alternate Approach for Treatment of Neurodegenerative Disorders.

[Astract]
Despite years of research, Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains incurable and thus poses a major health challenge in coming years. This neurodegenerative disease belongs to a heterogeneous group of human tauopathies, characterized by the extracellular deposition of beta amyloid-AÎ² and intracellular accumulation of tau protein in neuronal and glial cells, whereby tau pathology best correlates with disease progression. For decades, several disease-modifying agents were brought to clinical studies with promising efficacy in preclinical trials; however, all of the subsequent clinical trials failed. Therefore, the pursuit for therapeutic agents for the treatment of AD and other tauopathies still continue. Recent evidences show previously unidentified role of peripheral immune system in regulating the inflammatory status of the brain, mainly the dendritic cells. A decrease in functionality and count of dendritic cells has been observed in Alzheimer's disease. Here, we discuss a potential role of dendritic cell-based vaccines as therapeutic approach in ameliorating disease pathogenesis in AD and other tauopathies.
