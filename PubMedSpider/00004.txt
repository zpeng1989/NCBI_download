BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of TNF-α and IL-10 on the expression of ICAM-1 and CD31 in human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC). MATERIAL AND METHODS HCAEC was treated with 0, 2.5 μg/l, 5 μg/l, and 10 μg/l of TNF-α for 2 h, 6 h, and 10 h, and with 0 μg/l, 10 μg/l, 100 μg/l, and 200 μg/l of IL-10 for 5 h, 10 h and 15 h, respectively. RNA inference of TNF-αR was performed with siRNA. Real-time PCR, Western blot analysis, and ELSA were used to detect the mRNA level and protein level of ICAM-1 and CD31. RESULTS TNF-α significantly increased the mRNA and protein expression of ICAM-1 (P<0.05), and 2.5 μg/l TNF-α had the most obvious effect. RNAi of TNF-aR reduced the induction of TNF-α on the mRNA and protein expression of ICAM-1 (P<0.05). TNF-α significantly decreased the CD31 in the supernatant (P<0.05), and 2.5 μg/l TNF-a had the most obvious effect. IL-10 significantly decreased the ICAM-1 protein level. IL-10 decreased the mRNA expression and the protein expression of CD31. The effect on mRNA was not significant (P>0.05), while the effect on the protein expression was significant (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS TNF-α and IL-10 treatment can affect the expression of ICAM-1 and CD31 in HCAEC.
