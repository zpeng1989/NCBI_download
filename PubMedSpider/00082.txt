Top-Down Characterization of Proteins with Intact Disulfide Bonds Using Activated-Ion Electron Transfer Dissociation.

[Astract]
Here we report the fragmentation of disulfide linked intact proteins using activated-ion electron transfer dissociation (AI-ETD) for top-down protein characterization. This fragmentation method is then compared to the alternative methods of HCD, ETD, and EThcD. We analyzed multiple precursor charge states of the protein standards bovine insulin, α-lactalbumin, lysozyme, β-lactoglobulin, and trypsin inhibitor. In all cases we found that AI-ETD provides a boost in protein sequence coverage information and the generation of fragment ions from within regions enclosed by disulfide bonds. AI-ETD shows the largest improvement over the other techniques when analyzing highly disulfide linked and low charge density precursors ions. This substantial improvement is attributed to the concurrent irradiation of the gas phase ions while the electron-transfer reaction is taking place, mitigating non-dissociative electron transfer, helping unfold the gas phase protein during the electron transfer event, and preventing disulfide bond reformation. We also show that AI-ETD is able to yield comparable sequence coverage information when disulfide bonds are left intact relative to proteins that have been reduced and alkylated. This work demonstrates that AI-ETD is an effective fragmentation method for the analysis of proteins with intact disulfide bonds, dramatically enhancing sequence ion generation and total sequence coverage compared to HCD and ETD.
