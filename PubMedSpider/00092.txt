OBJECTIVE:Endometriosis is a common disease in women of reproductive age. Characteristics of endometriosis include invasion, metastasis, and recurrence, which are similar to those of malignant tumors. However, the etiology and pathogenesis of endometriosis are still not clear. This study aims to explore the mechanism of 3,6-dihydroxyflavone (3,6-DHF) in the development of endometriosis.
