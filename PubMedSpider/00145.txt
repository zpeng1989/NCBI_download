[Title]
Phylogenetic comparison of Epstein-Barr virus genomes.

[Astract]
Technologies used for genome analysis and whole genome sequencing are useful for us to understand genomic characterization and divergence. The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is an oncogenic virus that causes diverse diseases such as Burkitt's lymphoma (BL), nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL), and gastric carcinoma (GC). EBV genomes found in these diseases can be classified either by phases of EBV latency (type-I, -II, and -III latency) or types of EBNA2 sequence difference (type-I EBV, type-II EBV or EBV-1, EBV-2). EBV from EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) establishes type-III latency, EBV from NPC establishes type-II latency, and EBV from GC establishes type-I latency. However, other important factors play key roles in classifying numerous EBV strains because EBV genomes are highly diverse and not phylogenetically related to types of EBV-associated diseases. Herein, we first reviewed previous studies to describe molecular characteristics of EBV genomes. Then, using comparative and phylogenetic analyses, we phylogenetically analyzed molecular variations of EBV genomes and proteins. The review of previous studies and our phylogenetic analysis showed that EBV genomes and proteins were highly diverse regardless of types of EBV-associated diseases. Other factors should be considered in determining EBV taxonomy. This review will be helpful to understand complicated phylogenetic relationships of EBV genomes.
